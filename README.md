# Liveries created by Yurie


# Questions

##  Why use github?

I can easily edit and push/pull liveries, no matter where I'm at. I can download the xcf (GIMP File) and edit anywhere you want. Github doesn't compress any data and I can easily manage my files including previous work, and use it whenever someone asks about my livery work.

##  How do I download the file? 
Just open the page it's on, then right click the image and select ``save image`` and download it onto your computer. All images are in 4096x4096 32bit.

## How do I browse this? 
This isn't really meant to be browsed. It's meant for me to be able to post a link to said file and provide people with an easy way to access the liveries I created. 

## I can't find the folder I need to
In each ticket, I paste in a link with a generic message. That link includes the following

- The liveries 
- The XCF files 
- The members of the
- The member's Discord ID
- The livery Ticket # when I claimed it
- Tebex Information about the member
- Vehicle Spawncode information
- Any notes needed
- If the purchase was VERIFIED
